    <h1>GSoC</h1>
    <div class="con">
        <p class="text">
        <h3>Prerequisite</h3>
        As GSoC is purely open source internship so you need to have knowledge of Git tools and how to use Github
        platform(because almost all projects are on Github), actually not specifically for GSoC but this a skill which I think
        is must for every developer and it’s better to learn it early.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="con">
        <h3>Step 1: Choosing the right project and organization</h3>
        To get this step right you have to go to the GSoC archives for organizations that are selected last year, look through
        their projects and and try to find the project that interests you, most of the organization that are selected last year
        are ought to be repeated.
        The organization that are selected for GSoC are announced almost one month prior to date when students application
        opens, so you got a lot of time to choose the org with the project that is best for you.
        It is not necessary that you totally understand every aspect of the projects, most projects are combination of different
        tech stack but you need to focus only your own tech. If you are a complete beginner and know a little about programming
        language then also there is no need to worry.
        Just look through the projects, shortlist the ones you find interesting, try to use their released products, think of
        improvement or new features, start learning the language it is using and try to implement those features.
        It is possible you don’t find your interest in first attempt but this process of choosing project is hit and trial, but
        you need to constantly keep making efforts till you find one.
    </div>
    <div class="con">
        <h3>Step 2: Joining the project mailing list and get yourself recognized</h3>
        This step is just a sub part of first step as for every project you find on GSoC there is a channel where all the
        discussion related to projects are done on platforms like gitter, slack etc. You need to join that channel, and get
        yourself recognized by drafting a short introductory message telling about yourself and asking them how to get started.
        Someone from the community will surely reply to you and will guide to how to get started with the project. This is
        important because this is the place where you can ask all your doubts and show you presence in the community.
    </div>
    <div class="con">
        <h3>Step 3: Get yourself familiarized with the project codebase and start contributing</h3>
        After you have chosen you project, go through their codebase on GitHub, look through their issues, find the simple
        issues the ones that you could solve or raise the issue on your own if you find one and start working on them, now here
        is one point that you need to keep in mind that Always ask before working on any issue either on channel or GitHub
        itself because there may be chance that somebody else is already working, it’s better to look through some old issues
        because there is very less probability that somebody is working on them.
        After choosing issues try to resolve them and if you have any doubt ask on channel and start making PR for them. Doing
        this will increase your for being selected.
    </div>
    <div class="con">
        <h3>Step 4: Start solving other people doubts in the community</h3>
        When you get familiar with the codebase and start resolving issues then always try to help other with doubts, this will
        be your added advantage.
        Never try to misguide anybody because after all its a community where people code and learn together.
    </div>
    <div class="con">
        <h3>Step 5 Making a proposal</h3>
        This is the most crucial and deciding step, when the student application period start then you get almost one month to
        submit your proposal.
        Read the guidelines on GSoC website on how to make a good proposal.
        Now in this proposal I will recommend explaining your work along with wireframes which you can make using online tools
        like (I used JustinMind Prototyper and Moqups) because wireframes make your proposal look more attractive.
        Keep your proposal to the point and and deliverables should satisfy the requirement mentioned under project, don't
        include something unnecessary and unrealistic that is gonna reduce your chance of being selected.
        Important: If you get in touch with one of the mentors or if possible try to meet him in person then he could help you
        by reviewing the draft of your proposal and providing you early feedback, this could maximize your chances to get
        selected.
    </div>
    <div class="con">
        <h3>After submitting proposal</h3>
        Don’t stop contributing, because the review by mentors take upto one month more and in this time you can actually start
        working on some of the deliverables you mentioned on your proposal and believe me mentors take your contributions in
        consideration during selection procedure.
