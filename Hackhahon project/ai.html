    <p style="color:crimson" font-size>Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike
        the natural intelligence displayed by
        humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former and the
        latter
        categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as AGI (Artificial General
        Intelligence) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called ABI (Artificial Biological
        Intelligence). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that
        perceives its
        environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the
        term
        "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions
        that humans
        associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

        As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
        definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't
        been
        done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,
        having become a routine technology. Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully
        understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),
        autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.</p>
    <h1>Artificial Intelligence in Web Develeopment</h1>
    <p>Machine Learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, offers another advantage in person-machine interactions.
        Without
        learning capabilities, applications will approach a problem in the same way time after time, and make the same
        mistake
        without modifying or optimizing the solution based on prior experience.

        Machine Learning is an enabling technology that allows web applications to adapt over time by observing and
        learning
        from users' habits, idiosyncrasies, and preferences. User experience improves as a result of the applications
        just being
        smarter.



        With the aforementioned competitive advantages, why are AI-enabled websites not deployed everywhere as of today?
        One
        reason is that, despite its long history, AI is still an emerging technology as far as mainstream Information
        Technology
        is concerned. The tools that AI uses (such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, Markov chains, Bayes
        classifiers) are
        nothing but gibberish to mainstream web developers. To build artificial intelligence into a web application from
        scratch
        is out of the reach for most companies.



        The potential of commercializing AI did not escape the attention of the top global web technology players.
        Google,
        Facebook, and companies of that ilk have come up with AI toolkits that enable the plugging of ready-made natural
        language understanding and machine learning features into web applications.

        wit.ai and Dialogflow (formerly api.ai) are free services owned by Facebook and Google respectively. In
        contrast, Amazon
        Lex, IBM Watson, Microsoft LUIS are commercial paid services.



        The AI toolkits offered by global industry leaders have made possible the adoption of AI in enterprise web
        applications.
        You no longer need to hire AI PhDs to empower your websites with natural language understanding capabilities.

        Instead, mainstream web developers can integrate AI into chatbots on your existing web and mobile technology
        platforms.
        Developers do not need to be retrained to code in esoteric AI programming languages to take advantage of the
        technology.
        Instead, they work with APIs and tools which they are already familiar with, for instance, Python, Ruby, C++.
        Java,
        .Net, Node.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.



        Deploying AI using the above toolkits is not without challenges. Despite the toolkits' best effort to hide the
        intricacies of artificial intelligence, developers still need to learn a new lingo and concepts such as agents,
        intents,
        entities, and actions. It is reassuring, however, to know that online documentation is readily available for
        bringing
        developers up to speed with the toolkits. Learning to integrate and customize the technology is very much
        feasible.



        A more formidable challenge for integrating the toolkits is that the software requires additional customization
        in order
        for it to understand the specific concepts in your particular application domain. These toolkits are designed to
        be
        general-purpose starting points for understanding day-to-day language constructs, and may not be specific enough
        to
        parse the domain-specific concepts or the typical tasks that your web visitors may wish accomplished.

        Consequently, human trainers must provide the software with a concept hierarchy that is specific to your
        application. In
        addition, to improve the accuracy of sentence parsing for your particular application domain, trainers must
        explicitly
        provide sentence examples of the typical requests that your applications are designed to handle.

        This training component is very time-consuming and tedious, yet necessary in order to reduce the chance of
        errors in
        understanding customers requests.



        To overcome the initial training hurdles and to jumpstart the adoption of AI toolkits, toolkit vendors have
        started to
        provide pre-built domain models that target specific industries and tasks. For example, Dialogflow offers
        pre-built
        agents that target industries such as coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, airlines, and common tasks such as
        product
        support, map navigation, web search, etc. Microsoft LUIS features pre-built domains for taxis, restaurant
        reservation,
        movie theatres, fitness tracking, etc.

        The trend to provide prepackaged domains will definitely shorten the time to deploy AI functionalities in web
        applications.</p>
    <h1 style="color:darkblue">Future of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 242)">The rise of AI-enabled software has the potential of revolutionizing how customers
        interact with online enterprises. It
        is not inconceivable that, in the near future, a chatbot is the first point of contact between the customer and
        the
        online enterprise.

        The chatbot will analyze the needs of the customer based on prior natural language interaction, whether it be
        for
        product inquiry, troubleshooting, or sales. The chatbot has self-knowledge of its own capabilities and
        limitations and
        will resolve all issues that are within its capabilities.

        For those issues that it cannot resolve, the chatbot will escalate them to the appropriate second-level human
        analyst
        for successful resolution. AI-enabled chatbots can be the next-generation enterprise digital assistants of your
        brand on
        the Internet.</p>
